# Haaretz RSS Feed

End-to-end app (frontend in jQuery and backend in Python) to display news from Haaretz Israel Culture !

## Introduction

The easiest way to get timely updates from a site is to consume its RSS feed (Rich Site Summary). You also have the possibility to refresh the page while clicking one the button "refresh".

This exercice was an introduction for me to use routing and api.

## Installation

Download [feedparser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/feedparser) by running the following commande : 

```bash
pip install feedparser
```

## Usage

Run the app by running the file python.py with Python and take a look : [http://localhost:7000/](http://localhost:7000/)
